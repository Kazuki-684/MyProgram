## Description of the files
1.InternShip
---
This is a program I created to streamline operations at my long-term internship site.
This program searches for customers by their skills and puts them in a selective state. It incorporates a mechanism to avoid selecting the same person over and over again. The selected persons are put into a CSV file, which can be loaded the next time a search is performed.

2.forocr

This is a program I created for a college project. The assignment was to "develop a proposal to promote the Digital Rural City concept using RESTful openapi.
I thought it would be useful to digitize prescriptions and other documents using image recognition, so I did a quick search for an API that provided OCR, but couldn't find any free ones.
So I decided to create my own using tesseract to understand REST. This is not a practical application, but I am posting it as a portfolio.
Here is how I actually used tesseract.

4.hhrplot.c

This is a GUI application of a hit-and-home run game program written in C using GTK.
A hit-and-home run game is a game in which the player has to guess a four-digit number that is generated by the program at the start of the game (without the player's knowledge).
